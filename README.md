# Multi-Cloud E-Commerce Platform Infrastructure

## Objective

Create an ultra-complex e-commerce infrastructure deployed across AWS, GCP, and on-premises environments. The infrastructure must support microservices, event-driven processing, hybrid cloud connectivity, advanced CI/CD pipelines, security compliance (PCI-DSS), data replication, cross-cloud disaster recovery, and high availability with cost optimization. It must also incorporate DevSecOps principles, comprehensive observability, and multi-tenant architecture support.

- Use AWS SSO and Google Identity for centralized identity management across both clouds.

#### 6.2. Secret Management & Encryption
- AWS Secrets Manager and Google Secret Manager for secure storage of API keys, credentials, and other sensitive information.
- KMS (Key Management Service) in both AWS and GCP for managing encryption keys and enabling data encryption at rest for RDS, Cloud SQL, and S3/Cloud Storage.

#### 6.3. Security Best Practices
- PCI-DSS Compliance: Implement all required controls (e.g., encryption, audit logs, secure access) for handling payment data across AWS and GCP.
